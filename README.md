# QuantifiedSelfSergio
Solution for quantified self.

This solution is based on Google Spreadsheets supported by Google scripts with data provided by different sources, being these currently FitBit and User Input, with the aid of IFTTT recipes and an Android device.
Currently, FitBit provides mainly sleep data. The user provides the rest of the data easily by just pushing a button in an Android device to maximize speed and ease of use.
